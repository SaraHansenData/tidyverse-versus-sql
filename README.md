# tidyverse-versus-sql
This is my reference document for equivalent R tidyverse and SQL queries.

I recommend starting from the [web page](https://sarahansendata.github.io/tidyverse-versus-sql/) if you would like to explore the full project!

The docs folder contains the R Markdown file and the HTML page.
